# Note Taker

# A fullstack note-taking application that features dynamically updated HTML, built with JavaScript and powered by JQuery. 

This app was built in order to get practice with servers, as well as writing routes for backend to an existing frontend. This app works as a note taker for the user, who can save, edit and delete notes.

You must also install uniqid (for random ID generation) and Express (for running a server on your machine), which you can install by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid).
